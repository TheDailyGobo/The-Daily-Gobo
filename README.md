# The Daily Gobo - Introduction
Welcome to The Daily Gobo, the best blog for Scratch ever! We have many writers and moderators (mods), and don't worry! We aren't hackers. Only trusted Scratchers are chosen as writers to comply with the Scratch Community Guidelines.

We use ScratchAuth for our site, so that users can verify themselves with their Scratch accounts. They can then view, love, and favorite blog posts, just like Scratch!

The Daily Gobo is NOT associated with the Scratch Team or organization in any way, we are completely separate. This is completely fan-made property.

For info about the Community Guidelines, why not check out the ones on Scratch? Our rules are similar to them.
